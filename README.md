Kaggle Competition PlaygroundSeries Season 3 Episode 7, Reservation Cancellation Prediction. Synthetic DataSet

This is a Kaggle Competition Project, it's a binary classification problem. I preprocessed the data and trained several models to predict reservation status. 
Best model was XGBClassifier, but best prediction was a composite model with 4 models to counter bias from each other. 

I tried to compete clean and not abuse any of the bugs or exploits that were exposed on the competition community, like data leakage or repeated test values from original dataset.
This sets me back in ranking, but I focus on learning and improving my skills.
